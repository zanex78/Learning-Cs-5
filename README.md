# Learning4 C#
This is the fourth repository of me learning the basics of C#. Im currently learning from a (in my oppinion) very good youtube tutorial series.
This series of learning C# will have 7 repositories since there are only 7 Episodes.
In every new repository of mine there will be the youtube link of the current used repository.
